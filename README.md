# TaskManager
TaskManager CRUD

This is a Task Manager system for a School/college using SpringBoot and java Technology stack.
We use H2 as backend and note that since its in memory every time you restart the app, old data will be wiped out.
We expose REST end points for UI to consume
UI is an Angular application calling REST end points directly.
